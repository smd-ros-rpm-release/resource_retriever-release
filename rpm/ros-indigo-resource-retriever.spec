%description
This package retrieves data from url-format files such as http://, ftp://,
package:// file://, etc., and loads the data into memory. The package:// url for
ros packages is translated into a local file:// url. The resourse retriever was
initially designed to load mesh files into memory, but it can be used for any
type of data. The resource retriever is based on the the libcurl library.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
